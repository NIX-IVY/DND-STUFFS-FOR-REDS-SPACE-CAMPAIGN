# The Corvidae

The Corvidae is a syndicate that is believed to have been around since Ancient Earth was still a habitable planet and possibly even before the "Era of Stars" as is told in their murals. There are records of what it was like to live on the planet and descriptions of the old daily life. Since then however The Corvidae have become a close to nomadic syndicate, following new colonies in their creation and branching off to all corners of known civilisations and possibly further. Many of the branches within each colony grew with them, but never tried to disrupt their growths. They found their place within each colony in their own ways, so each branch of the syndicate is different to any other you may find.

Within known civilisation there are 7 confirmed branches of The Corvidae to still be operational, this number is believed to be greatly insignificant to the actual number of Corvidae branches in other colonies. The 7 confirmed Branches are:  

- Corvid Astrologican 
- Dawn Corvidae
- Draconid Corvidae
- Korax Historia
- Corvid Lunar 
- South Corvid [[A Black Garden Syndicate](blackgarden#black-garden)] 
- Nor√∞r Hrafn 

Of these confirmed branches the only ones believed to contact the other branches is Korax Historia and Corvid Astrologican, the others have been radio silent for unknown reasons. Each of the branches is run by a different leader or Silver as the syndicate calls them. They do not unite under one overall leader as its believed they perished when Ancient Earth was destroyed. 

Since the death of their leader, each branch has followed the same scriptures, rules and hierarchy.  Each of the syndicates base of operations are referred to as a "Nest". Their ranking system is as follows in order of importance from most to least:

- Silver (the leader(s))
- Raven
- Carrion
- Hooded Crow / Rooks
- Magpie / Feather
- Wings
- Fledgling

Each rank is respected within the syndicate with higher ranks being shown more respect. Unlike other syndicate factions which might only respect the higher ranks. However there are restrictions and procedures each rank must follow, such as addressing a higher ranking individual.  
### Silver
The Silver is the leader of each branch, within a branch there may be more than one Silver. They are very rarely seen by anyone except Ravens.

### Ravens
Ravens carry out the will of Silvers. They are seen on important duties and passing down orders from the leaders. They only fight when needed, such as a territorial war.

### Carrions
Carrions are the syndicates highly trained soldiers. They are the go to for when a large battle may need to be fought or when an execution is to be done. There is usually one or two within a group of Rooks.

### Hooded Crows
Hooded Crows are the assassins within the syndicate. When a task requires no witnesses, a clean kill and no evidence a Hooded Crow will be sent out. They leave no calling cards unlike other syndicate assassins, unless the job requires them to.

### Rooks
Rooks are soldiers and enforcers of the syndicate. If a Corvidae syndicate memeber is spotted patrolling an area, out on a mission or simply spotted on the streets they are most likely a Rook. Within some branches they also maintain morale of the syndicate, throwing parties, running a private lounge etc.

### Magpies
Magpies are the grunts of the syndicate, sent on smaller jobs, joining rooks on their jobs or patrolling smaller areas. Some Magpies are different in that they choose to stay within this rank,from then on being known as a Feather until they decide otherwise. A Feathers duties are closer to that of a mercenary but with the syndicate to back them.

### Wings and Fledglings
Wings and Fledglings are trainees within the syndicate, the difference being Fledglings are never sent out on jobs whilst Wings are sent on lesser jobs to support the Rooks.

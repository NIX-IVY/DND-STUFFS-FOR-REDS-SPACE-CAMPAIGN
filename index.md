# Sierra Watson's Story

**Name**: Sierra [Watson](watsonfamily#the-watson-family)  
**Age**: 36  
**Species**: Human  
**Occupation**: [South Corvid](thecorvidae#the-corvidae) [Rook](thecorvidae#rooks)


Sierra grew up in the ecumenopolis [Black Garden](blackgarden#black-garden), growing up within [District South 17](blackgarden#south-17) a mid-low class district controlled by the Fractal. Sierra spent her life avoiding getting into trouble with the surrounding factions and tried to keep to herself. When she was 19 she was working as a waitress at the same restaurant her mother worked in. She would usually work late up until the restaurant shut for the night and instead of heading straight home would take detours and explore the district. Between Fractal and The Jade Call the streets were relatively safe and the night life of the district was always lively.

### South 17

District South 17 a mid-low class district controlled by Fractal, using the space left behind from mining operations in the area, now that all the resources in the area have been bled dry. The district itself features tower blocks used for cramped apartments, streets filled with markets, neon signs advertising the district's many businesses, and plenty of shady alleys for the criminals of the city to hide away in.
